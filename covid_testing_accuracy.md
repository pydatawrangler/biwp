$$Pr(COVID19|positive) = \frac{Pr(positive|COVID19) Pr(COVID19)} {Pr(positive)}$$

$$Pr(positive) = Pr(positive|COVID19) Pr(COVID19) + Pr(positive|HEALTHY) (1 âˆ’ Pr(COVID19))$$

```
PrPC = 0.9999  # probability of a positive test result given you have COVID19
PrPH = 0.0001  # probability of a positive test result if you do not have COVID19 
PrC = 0.001  # probability of having COVID19
PrP = PrPC * PrC + PrPH * (1-PrC)  # marginal probability of having a positive test
PrCP = PrPC * PrV / PrP  # use Bayes to estimate probability of having COVID19 given a positive test
PrCP
